## Brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

## User Testing

### Remote testing

I had two people from the class test my website remotely, give me feedback and adjust my code thereafter.

### In-person testing

I had three different people use and test my webpage in-person while I watched, without trying to guide them on using the webpage.

The following devices was used:

| First user                   | Second user     | Third user      |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Windows 1920x1080 Stationary | MacBook pro 13" | MacBook pro 13" |
| iPhone 13                    | iPhone 14       | iPhone 13       |

First user had difficulties reading on some paragraphs, so I justed fonts.

Second user had a lot of white space between body and footer, also needed a little guiding on how to create a venue

Third user wanted more margin in the description paragraph on the venue page on mac
